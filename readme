Blinkonoff is a simple python script that tests LED circuits controlled
by the GPIO on a raspberrypi. It is meant to be a simple means of testing 
and learning.  It uses GPIO pin 7 but that can easily be changed.

commands

on : turn led on 
off : turn led off
blink : blink the led for a little bit
quit : quit the program
